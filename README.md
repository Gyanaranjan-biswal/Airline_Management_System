Airline Management System – README

The Airline Management System is a Java-based application developed using Spring Boot, Core Java concepts, and relational database connectivity. This system aims to provide a smooth and efficient platform for managing airline operations, focusing on functionalities such as ticket booking, boarding pass generation, and journey details tracking. The project follows a clean architectural approach where controllers, services, repositories, and model classes are separated to ensure maintainability and scalability.

This application allows users to search for flights based on travel routes and dates, view seat availability, and proceed with secure ticket booking. Once a ticket is confirmed, the system automatically generates a unique PNR and allocates passenger details. A digital boarding pass is produced after booking confirmation, containing essential information such as passenger name, flight number, seat number, gate information, and departure time. The system also maintains complete journey details for each passenger, enabling quick access to travel history and booking records.

The backend is built using Java and Spring Boot, making use of core Java features like object-oriented programming, collections, exception handling, and modular design. Spring Boot simplifies configuration and provides RESTful API endpoints for interaction between client applications and the server. Hibernate and JPA are used for seamless database operations, while MySQL or PostgreSQL serves as the primary database. The system includes a well-structured schema designed to handle flight data, passenger information, schedules, bookings, and transaction records.

The project is easy to run and configure. After cloning the repository, the user only needs to update the application.properties file with their database credentials. Maven handles dependency management, and the application can be launched using the Spring Boot run command. Once started, the system becomes accessible on the default server port, where all API endpoints can be tested through tools like Postman.

Overall, the Airline Management System offers a professional, modular, and reliable backend solution for airline operations. It demonstrates strong integration of Java technologies with database handling and provides essential real-world functionalities such as booking management, boarding pass creation, and journey tracking. This project is suitable for academic purposes, enterprise experimentation, and enhancement into a complete airline reservation platform.
